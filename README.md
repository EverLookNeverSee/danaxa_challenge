Danaxa Technical Interview Challenge


## Challenge Description
Suppose we are developing a new labeling tool to annotate masks in a video.
Labeling all the frames of a video with a great accuracy takes a lot of time and
cost. In order to make annotation process faster, we need to use semi-
automated or automated labelling methods. Therefore, we need to implement
a method to annotate an object in a few frames and the tool keep detecting
that object in next frames. Ultimately, we want the tool to annotate all video
frames itself after annotating a few frames.
